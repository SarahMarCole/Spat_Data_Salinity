# Spat_Data_Salinity
Using R to visualize monthly spat monitoring data and salinity from the Indian River Lagoon and the St. Lucie Estuary. Water quality data is available for public download.

## Overview
This project collects 4 years of data to create a visualization to help understand the changes in oyster spat in relation to location and water quality (salinity)

This data collection comprises of monthly oyster spat monitoring from June 2020 to May 2023 in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) and St. Lucie Estuary (IRL). Salinity data is publicly available at (https://irlon.org). 

Here, identical data is provided and processed. Which visualization do you prefer while examining the final products? Which would a customer prefer? Why?
