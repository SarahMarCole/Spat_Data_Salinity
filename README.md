# Spat_Data_Salinity
Using R to visualize monthly spat monitoring data and salinity from the Indian River Lagoon and the St. Lucie Estuary. Water quality data is available for public download.

## Overview
This project collects 4 years of data to create a visualization to help understand the changes in oyster spat in relation to location and water quality (salinity)

This data collection comprises of monthly oyster spat monitoring from June 2020 to May 2023 in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) and St. Lucie Estuary (IRL). Salinity data is publicly available at (https://irlon.org). 

Is salnity driving the differences in spat counts? What other water quality parameters should we test?

## üìÅ Files
* [master_SpatCounts_deploydate.xlsx](https://github.com/SarahMarCole/Excel-or-R-Month-Monitoring-Oyster-Spat/blob/main/master_SpatCounts.xlsx) is the excel file contain all spat data used in visualization. Formulas to obtain standardized 28-day month and other cleaning occur here.  
* [Salinity.xlsx](https://github.com/SarahMarCole/Spat_Data_Salinity/blob/main/Salinity.xlsx) is the excel file that contains the salinity and water quality data. This was publicly downloaded from (https://irlon.org). File has been cleaned from original download. 
* [Spat_script.R](https://github.com/SarahMarCole/Spat_Data_Salinity/blob/main/Spat_script.R) is the R script for data analysis and visualization.
